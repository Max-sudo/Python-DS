1) Anomaly Detection</br></br>
An exploration of various uni/multivariate anomaly detection techniques with unsupervised and supervised applications.</br>

2) Utility Clustering</br></br>
A novel implementation of methodologies described in the following paper: The Utility of Clustering in Prediction Tasks: Shubhendu Trivedi, Zachary A. Pardos and Neil T. Heffernan (https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~shubhendu/Papers/clustering_bagging.pdf). Ultimately, this paper focuses on reducing error in prediction tasks by leveraging clustering as a means of pre-processing.</br>

3) CADE</br></br>
A novel implementation of methedologies described in the following paper: Classifier-Adjusted Density Estimation for Anomaly Detection and One-Class Classification: Lisa Friedland, Amanda Gentzel and David Jensen (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4e6/033069a8569ba16f64da3061538bcb90bec6.pdf). This script leverages supervised learning to find a solution to an unsupervised problem by creating fake event data comprised of uniform versions of variables from the original data set. Supervised models are built to classify the fake events and the real non-events. These models then score the original data to produce an anomaly score.

4) Time Series - Energy Prediction</br></br>
This project focuses on predicting energy use via time series modeling. Specifically, energy use is modeled using linear regression (OLS), exponential smoothing, SARIMA, and ensemble models.</br>

5) Target Shuffling</br></br>
A novel implementation of methodologies described in the following paper: Evaluate the Vailidity of Your Discovery with Target Shuffling: John Elder)(https://www.elderresearch.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/10/Whitepaper_Evaluate_the_Validity_of_Your_Discovery_with_Target_Shuffling.pdf). Target shuffling provides an straightfoward, easy to implement, and intuitive way to gauge the validity of modeling results.
