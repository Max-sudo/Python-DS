1) Anomaly Detection</br></br>
An exploration of various uni/multivariate anomaly detection techniques with unsupervised and supervised applications.</br>

2) Utility Clustering</br></br>
A novel implementation of methodologies described in the following paper: The Utility of Clustering in Prediction Tasks: Shubhendu Trivedi, Zachary A. Pardos and Neil T. Heffernan (https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~shubhendu/Papers/clustering_bagging.pdf). Ultimately, this paper focuses on reducing error in prediction tasks by leveraging clustering as a means of pre-processing.</br>

3) Time Series - Energy Prediction</br></br>
This project focuses on predicting energy use via time series modeling. Specifically, energy use is modeled using linear regression (OLS), exponential smoothing, SARIMA, and ensemble models.</br>

4) CADE</br></br>
